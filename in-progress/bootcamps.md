## The Issues
- Flex vs part time
  - will I be available full time, or try to work around job?
- Cost: payment plans or, can I defer payment until I have a job?
- Custom curriculum: Learning what I want to learn
- Career coaching / Job placement
- Speak to alumni or current students?
  - Attend a sample class?

## My situation
I've been learning Python and JavaScript for about a year and have worked with HTML and CSS for many years. I've recently decided to follow a fullstack web development track. This would include React.js, Node, a database language (amongst other crucial programming tools). I have a portfolio of small front-end projects, but am interested in making a much more impressive portfolio.
