JS for dummies. Lots of good stuff. Code for download (got it)

- recursion

- JavaScript: FCC, WesBos, Watch and Code, EJS
- Python: OOP, MIT, Books
- Git / GitHub (which tutorial is best? Laracasts?)
- SLACK:
- 	Collaboration: Random Music with MIDI, Hangman
- 	Helping beginners
- Angular
- Aurelia
- Laravel
- Job Interview
- Computer Science (looking for best books)

- !!!Treehouse!!!

- Started: EdX - damned if I’ll learn C right now.

- FreeCodeCamp - full stack (MEAN)
- Wes Bos - JavaScript 30
- Watch and Code
- Python books / MIT OCW 2016 / Corey Schafer
- GitHub Desktop (until I figure out Git at the command line)
- Eloquent JavaScript (ahead of me, but I’m getting more familiar)

- I still want the perfect text-editor / IDE (what am I missing?)
- I’m still mystified by certain things - my bookmarks project. How to make it awesome?
- I have NO idea what to make with a basic Angular JS app. 
- Laravel - check that out? Want to post MTFA in the most logical way. Static could work though?
- The Job Interview - a big topic to start researching.

- Networking / Pair Programming - I’m excited about adding people to Limitless Coders slack channel and possibly brewing up some projects! To what end, IDK, but it’s good to be able to work with people, right?

- The big picture - I don’t want to work more than 30 hours a week. Why? I’d like to save up and make my own company. What? I feel like I have lots of great ideas, but if you ask me what they are…I have no idea. I’m not clear on the end result. I wish I was clearer.
