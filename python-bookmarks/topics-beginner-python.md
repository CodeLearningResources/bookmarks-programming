Compound statements — Python 3.6.1rc1 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html) - "Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line. The if, while and for statements implement traditional control flow constructs. try specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements."

There is also a sorted() built-in function that builds a new sorted list from an iterable. In this document, we explore the various techniques for sorting data using Python. Sorting Basics ¶ A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the sorted() function. It returns a new sorted list: >>> >>> sorted ([ 5 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 4 ]) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
